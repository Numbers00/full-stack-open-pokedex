In an application that is programmed in Python:

1. Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by google.
Answer: **Pylint** could serve as linter, and **pytest** for testing, and **setuptools** for building and distribution.

2. What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask google!
Answer: Gitlab CI, Bamboo, Circle CI, TeamCity, Travis CI, to name a few.

3. Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?
Answer: From what I gather, beginners would find a cloud-based environment advantageous due to its simplicity and easy maintenance, making it a suitable choice for this project. With experience, they can decide whether to transition to a self-hosted setup. Factors like uptime, control, security, and scalability should be weighed, as both environments have their merits and drawbacks.
